# Introduction

[welcome](../home.md)

A compiler reads files in one language, translates them,
and outputs files in another language. You can implement
a compiler in any language, including the same language it compiles,
a process called self-hosting.

This chapter was an explaination on what / how to implement
a language called lox

The first part is just getting it running (will be done in java)
The second part gets more into the details (will be done in c)

I want to try to do this in rust and maybe python for the concepts

Also I'm going to try to do all the challenges

## Challenge 1
>
> There are at least six domain-specific languages used
in the little system I cobbled together to write
and publish this book. What are they?

Markdown, Jinja2, Makefile, SASS, CSS, HTML.

## Challenge 2
>
> Get a “Hello, world!” program written and running
in Java. Set up whatever makefiles or IDE projects
you need to get it working. If you have a debugger,
get comfortable with it and step through your program as it runs.

Can checkout the code in challenges folder

## Challenge 3
>
> Do the same thing for C. To get some practice with pointers,
define a doubly linked list of heap-allocated strings.
Write functions to insert, find, and delete items from it. Test them.

I did insert, find and skipped delete because I got the main jist of the exercise
